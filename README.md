# GarbageSeekers-Game

A game project implemented for the needs of the Interactive Systems course in 2020-2021

## Game Goal

An environmental game that aims to raise awareness about the trash pollution and to show that **one man's trash is another man's treasure**.

## Game Concept

A group of aliens is forced to visit earth due to the lack of energy in the spaceship reactor. They land on an inhabited island. Their goal is to find a weird plastic resource, with which they will be able to produce the required energy that they need. Luckily, this valuable resource exists in the garbage of humans, AND IT IS EVERYWHERE. So, the collection starts.

However, the residents of the island, seeing aliens wondering around, they get scared and aggressive, so they hunt, and attack the aliens. In order to survive in this hostile environment, the aliens the have to freeze the humans, and continue their tasks.

When the collection is complete, the spaceship repairing starts. However, new problems will come up.
