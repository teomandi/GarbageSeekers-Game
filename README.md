## Game 

An environmental game that aims to reduce awareness about the trash pollution and to show that **one man's trash is another man's treasure**.

## Game Concept

A group of aliens is forced to visit earth due to the lack of energy in the spaceship reactor. They land on an inhabited island. Their goal is to find a weird plastic resource, with which they will be able to produce the required energy that they need. Luckily, this valuable resource exits in the garbage of humans, AND THEY ARE EVERYWHERE. So, the collection start.

However, the residents of the island, seeing aliens wondering around, they get scared and aggressive, so they hunt, and they attack the aliens. The aliens in order to survive in this hostile environment, the have to freeze the humans, and continue their tasks.

When the collection is complete, the spaceship repairing starts. However, new problems will come up.
